          <p>I'm surprised nobody wrote about Cyndaquil and the <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Totodile">other</a> <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Johto">Johto</a> <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Chikorita">starters</a>. Come on, <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+Gold+%2526+Silver">Pokemon Gold & Silver</a> was released in 2000, and <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Everything2">Everything2</a> was created from <a href="https://everything2.com/title/E1">E1</a> in 1999. <strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN</strong> <small>/rant</small></p>
          <p>Oh, we're talking about <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Cyndaquil">Cyndaquil</a>. <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Realization">Yeah.</a> So</p>

    <p><strong>Cyndaquil</strong> (Japanese: ヒノアラシ, <a href="https://everything2.com/title/transliteration">translit.</a> <em>Hinoarashi</em>)  is one of the <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon">Pokemon</a> starters you can choose from in your <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+Gold+%26+Silver">Johto adventure</a>. It has a <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokedex">National Pokedex</a> number of #155. Quil's a fire type and has three stages in <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+evolution+isn't+evolution">"evolution"</a>, just like <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Charmander">Charmander</a> (which has <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Charmeleon">Charmeleon</a> and <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Charizard">Charizard</a>). It evolves into <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Quilava">Quilava</a> when leveled up to at least level 14, which will evolve into <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Typhlosion">Typhlosion</a> starting at level 36.</p>
    
    <p>Cyndaquil is small, bipedal, and looks like an <a href="https://everything2.com/title/echidna">echidna</a>, with a bluish back and a cream-colored front. You will never see a Cyndaquil with its eyes "open". Think of it like <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Brock">Brock</a>, but is a small Pokemon. Cyndaquil <abbr title="Pokemon names can be plural. This is grammatically correct.">are</abbr> easily intimidated (hence why in <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+Mystery+Dungeon+Red+Rescue+Team">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red Rescue Team</a>, when the game sees that you are timid, you become a Cyndaquil). If you scare them, <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Make+me+angry+and+I'll+burn+you">provoke them to fight you</a>, or make them happy, their back will erupt into flames (which is what you see in the <a href="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/9/9b/155Cyndaquil.png">official art</a>, isn't that <a href="https://everything2.com/title/cute">cute</a>). Or they may just <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Defense+Curl">curl into a ball.</a></p>
    
    <p>As with all other new Pokemon in the <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Johto">Johto</a> <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokedex">Pokedex</a>, Cyndaquil reappears in future core series games like <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+Ruby+%26+Sapphire">Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire</a>. Cyndaquil also appears in spin-offs like the <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+Mystery+Dungeon">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon</a> series. In Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Cyndaquil is arguably the best starter to choose in Generation II (and IV for <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+HeartGold+%26+SoulSilver">Pokemon HeartGold & SoulSilver</a>), with <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Totodile">Totodile</a> being a close second. However, in <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+Mystery+Dungeon+Red+Rescue+Team">Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Red Rescue Team</a>, Cyndaquil is one of the worst starters, because the final evolution, <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Typhlosion">Typhlosion</a>, has no secondary type. Make <a href="https://everything2.com/title/Chikorita">Chikorita</a> your partner, and you're gonna play the hardest difficulty of the game (<a href="https://everything2.com/title/Chikorita+sucks">Chikorita sucks</a>).</p>
    
    <p>The name "Cyndaquil" comes from the words <em>cinder</em> (ashes) and <em>quill</em> (needle-like hairs). Combine them, you get an idea of a Pokemon that has flames that look like needles as its hair. It's Japanese name <em>Hinoarashi</em> on the other hand, may come from 火 <em>hi</em> (fire) and ヤマアラシ <em>yama-arashi</em> (<a href="https://everything2.com/title/porcupine">porcupine</a>).</p>
    
    <h2>Pokedex entries</h2>
      <p>Here are its Pokedex entries from Gold (HeartGold), Silver (SoulSilver) and Crystal:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <em>It is timid, and always curls itself up in a ball. If attacked, it flares up its back for protection.</em> (Gold & HeartGold)<br />
      <em>It usually stays hunched over. If it is angry or surprised, it shoots flames out of its back.</em> (Silver & SoulSilver)<br />
      <em>The fire that spouts from its back burns hottest when it is angry. The flaring flames intimidate foes.</em> (<a href="https://everything2.com/title/Pokemon+Crystal">Crystal</a>)
