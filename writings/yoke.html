    <h1>Yoke</h1>
    <div id="poem" class="txtcenter">
      <p>
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019">coronavirus</a> had caught us all by surprise<br />
      We thought that by our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">faith</a> in Jesus Christ<br />
      The virus wouldn’t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_lockdowns">affect</a> so many lives<br />
      But here we are, like a dog being bitten by lice<br />
      A lice that doesn’t care about our cries
      </p>
      <p>
      The plague revealed our <a href="https://yourstory.com/2020/04/coronavirus-pandemic-tells-story-humanity">wrongs</a><br />
      The heart of the state, the hierarchy, turned out to be <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/04/06/covid-19-and-the-failures-of-capitalism/">cold</a><br />
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">Capitalism</a> is a parasite that limits the masses’ growth<br />
      We had become slaves to this system that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_capitalism">old</a><br />
      It is now that this injustice shall be overthrown by our <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yoke#Verb">yoke</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      But before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution">that</a>, there’s a priority task that needs to be done<br />
      Billions of people, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus">code</a> had slapped into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death">gone</a><br />
      As rational beings, we must <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-isolation">stay inside our house</a><br />
      Not only for safety, but as solidarity to our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_deaths">fallen</a> loved ones<br />
      For when we finally win this fight, from the ashes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism">yesterday</a> we will rebuild into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism">something</a> we all love.
      </p>
      <p>
      More praise to the scientists’ genius works<br />
      More power to those in construction work<br />
      Give thanks to those who risk their lives as a nurse<br />
      Salute to the medical doctors who lead this effort<br />
      And most importantly, let us not forget to pray to Jesus Christ our Lord.
